**Notes**

```
Every Line of Java is converted to byte code
which is almost like assembly language which is 
the run/executed by the JVM.

CLI  COMMAND TO EXECUTE SAMPLE BYTE
CODE:

cd /src$ java com.caleb.Main

I Must be in the SRC Folder.

Java 11 has long term support and is my preffered
choice.

```

**Basic java anatomy**
```

public class Main {

    public void main(){
    
    }
   
}

(a)At the minimum we have the main class and the main method.

(b)Methods have got a return type for example in the function above the 
return type is void.

(c)then access modifiers..These define how our functions will be accessible to
other classes.We mostly use public.

Naming our classes and methods:

(a)PascalNamingConvention..the first letter of every word is uppercase.

(b)camelNamingConvention...


```
**Packages**
```
Help me organise and group classes for my application.

There are Two steps in running java code:

(a)Compilation

converts my code to byte code...

Byte code is hugely avantageous since it is platform
independent.

(b)Execution.
